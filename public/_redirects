# Cloudflare Pages redirects and rewrites
# Next.js static export generates HTML files for each route,
# so Cloudflare Pages will serve them directly.
# This file can be used for custom redirects if needed.

# Example: Redirect old URLs to new ones (uncomment and modify as needed)
# /old-page    /new-page    301
